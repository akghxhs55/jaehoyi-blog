# Personal Blog

This repository hosts my personal blog built with Next.js and content sourced from Notion.

## Project status
- This repository is not a template and is not accepting issues or pull requests.
- The codebase may change at any time without notice.

## Brief history
- Originally based on the open‑source project [`morethanmin/morethan-log`](https://github.com/morethanmin/morethan-log).
- The upstream repository is no longer maintained, and I’ve removed the fork relationship to keep this code independent for my own use.
- Many thanks to the original authors and contributors of `morethan-log`.

## Purpose
- Serve as my personal blog and playground for trying ideas around Notion‑powered content and Next.js.

## License
- Source code is available under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` for details.

## Acknowledgements
- `morethanmin/morethan-log` for the original foundation.
- The Notion and Next.js communities.
